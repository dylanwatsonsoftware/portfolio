Just putting a few thoughts down on things you should setup/change/download when you get a new Mac!

Note that order is important for some things. Particularly ensure OhMyZsh is installed first.

Manually install the following (using the documentation on the respective sites):

- Install OhMyZsh
- Install Homebrew
- Install SDKMan


- Setup Touch ID
  - Add fingerprint via settings
  - System Preferences > Touch ID > Add Fingerprint
- Install [Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) (Handy for switching the scroll direction if you have a normal mouse)
- Install homebrew apps i.e brew install <app>:
  - gradle
  - maven
  - nvm
    After installing nvm you will likely have to manually add something to your .zshrc - Look for it in the logs
```
nvm install node --lts # Install node lts
corepack enable # enable yarn
```

  - docker --cask
  - warp (A sexy terminal)
  - fork (git GUI)
  - insomnia (REST GUI - Like Postman)
  - visual-studio-code
  - rectangle (Window management)
- Install IntelliJ Toolbox
- Install Tenor GIF Keyboard
- Change the action for the CAPS LOCK key to Escape (Lets be honest, you donâ€™t use Caps Lock except to turn it off after you accidentally pressed it)
  - System Preferences > Keyboard > Modified Keys

- System Settings > Mouse > Secondary Click > Click Right Side
- System Settings > Trackpad > Tap to Click
- System Settings > Trackpad > Secondary Click > Click or Tap with Two Fingers
- System Settings > Trackpad > More Gestures (Just take note of them as some are very useful)
